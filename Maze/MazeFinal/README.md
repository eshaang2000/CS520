# Maze

## Eshaan Gandhi, Siddarth Mandayam

As roommates we have split the task equally. Sid focussed more on part 2 while I focused more on part 1. Being in close quaters helped a lot in collaborating. 

As far as all these python files are concerned, we are sorry there are so many. I would like to explain what each of them are

Grid.py - Part 1 strategy 1
Grid2.py - Part 1 strategy 2
Grid3.py - Part 1 strategy 3 - GTFO 
Analysis - We use an automation script to speed up the process
MazeThinning - Part 2
MazeThinningAnalysis - Part 2 Analysis

The report is called LaTeXReport.pdf
We hope you like our project.
